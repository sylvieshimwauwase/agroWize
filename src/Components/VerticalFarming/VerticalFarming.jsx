                <span className="paragraphSubHead">Vertical farming</span> is an innovative technique that involves
                growing crops in vertically stacked

                warehouses, or high-rise
                buildings. Unlike conventional horizontal farming that heavily
                relies on vast tracts of land,
                vertical farming makes efficient use of space by utilizing
                height.

                <p className="paragraphWrapper">
                  Growing tubers, such as potatoes or sweet potatoes, in
                  vertical farming setups requires special consideration due to
                  their underground growth habit and space requirements. Here's
                  a general overview of pre-planting, planting, and
                  post-planting methods for tubers in vertical farming:

                  <li>
                  <span className="ordListsSub">Pre-Planting Methods:</span>
                    <ul className="unordLists">
                      <li>
                      <span className="paragraphSubHead">a. Crop Selection:</span> Choose tuber crops that are
                        well-suited for vertical farming conditions. Look for
                        compact or dwarf varieties that produce smaller tubers
                        and can adapt to the limited space available in vertical
                        farming setups.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <span className="paragraphSubHead">b. Facility Design:</span> Design the vertical farming facility
                        to accommodate the specific needs of tuber crops. Ensure
                        sufficient depth and space in growing containers or
                        towers to accommodate tuber development underground.
                        Install appropriate lighting, irrigation, and climate
                        control systems to support tuber growth.

                      <li>
                      <span className="paragraphSubHead">c. Seed Selection:</span> Use high-quality seed tubers suited
                        to vertical farming conditions. Select disease-free,
                        firm tubers with multiple eyes or sprouts for optimal
                        germination and growth.

                      <li>
                      <span className="paragraphSubHead">a. Preparing Seed Tubers:</span> Prior to planting, prepare
                        seed tubers by cutting them into pieces containing at
                        least one eye or sprout. Allow cut surfaces to dry and
                        callus before planting to reduce the risk of rotting.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                      <span className="paragraphSubHead">b. Planting:</span> Plant prepared seed tubers in growing
                        containers or towers filled with growing medium. Place
                        seed tubers with sprouts facing upwards and bury them at
                        a suitable depth to allow for tuber development. Ensure
                        proper spacing between tubers to prevent overcrowding
                        and allow for adequate root development.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                      <span className="paragraphSubHead">c. Covering:</span> Cover planted seed tubers with a layer of
                        growing medium to protect them from light exposure and
                        promote root growth. Maintain appropriate moisture
                        levels in the growing medium to support tuber
                        development.

                    </ul>

                      <li>
                      <span className="paragraphSubHead">a. Nutrient Management:</span> Monitor and adjust nutrient
                        levels to support tuber growth throughout the growing
                        cycle. Ensure that tuber crops receive adequate
                        nutrients, particularly potassium, phosphorus, and
                        nitrogen, to support tuber development and yield.

                      <li>
                      <span className="paragraphSubHead">b. Watering and Irrigation:</span> Implement efficient watering
                        and irrigation systems to provide moisture to tuber
                        crops while minimizing water waste. Monitor soil
                        moisture levels or nutrient solution levels regularly
                        and adjust irrigation accordingly.

                      <li>
                      <span className="paragraphSubHead">c. Hilling:</span> As tuber plants grow, periodically add
                        additional growing medium or mulch around the base of
                        the plants to cover emerging tubers and promote further
                        growth. Hilling helps prevent tubers from being exposed
                        to light, which can cause greening and bitterness.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                      <span className="paragraphSubHead">d. Harvesting:</span> Harvest tubers when they reach maturity,
                        typically indicated by the senescence or yellowing of
                        the aboveground foliage. Carefully dig up tubers from
                        the growing containers or towers, taking care not to
                        damage them during harvest.

                  While growing tubers in vertical farming setups presents
                  certain challenges, with careful planning and adaptation of
