                  <h3>Vertical Farming</h3>
                  <h4>What is Vertical Farming?</h4>
                  <p>Vertical farming is an innovative technique that involves growing crops in vertically stacked 
                        <br />
                        layers, often in controlled environments like indoor facilities, warehouses, or high-rise 
                        <br />
                        buildings. Unlike conventional horizontal farming that heavily relies on vast tracts of land, 
                        <br />
                        vertical farming makes efficient use of space by utilizing height.

                  <h4>Key features of Vertical Farming</h4>
                  <p>Vertical farming is a modern agricultural technique that has several key features. 
                        <br/>
                        Some of them are:
                  </p>
                  <ol>
                        <li>Vertical Growing Structures: crops are oultivated in vertically stacked layers using 
                              <br />
                              shelves, racks, or towers. This method allows for high-density planting and optimal use of 
                              <br />
                              available space. 
                        </li>
                        <li>Controlled Environment: vertical farming facilities are equipped with climate control 
                        <br />
                              systems that carefully monitor and optimize temperature, humidity, light, and nutrient 
                              <br />
                              levels for plant growth. This control minimizes the impact of external factors such as 
                              <br />
                              weather and pests, resulting in consistent and predictable crop yields.
                        </li>
                        <li>Hydroponic or Aeroponic Systems: many vertical farms use hydroponic or aeroponic 
                        <br />
                              systems for soilless cultivation. In hydroponics, plants are grown in nutrient-rich water 
                              <br />
                              solutions, while in aeroponics, plants are misted with nutrient-rich air. These systems 
                              <br />
                              provide plants with essential nutrients, while minimizing water usage and eliminating the 
                              <br />
                              need for soil.
                        </li>
                        <li>Artificial Lighting: as natural sunlight may be limited in indoor environments, artificial 
                        <br />
                              lighting systems such as LED grow lights are used to provide the necessary light 
                              <br />
                              spectrum for photosynthesis. These lighting systems can be tailored to the specific needs 
                              <br />
                              of different crops and growth stages.
                        </li>
                        <li>Urban Agriculture: vertical farming, is highly suitable for urban areas with limited land 
                        <br />
                              availability and high demand for locally grown produce. Vertical farms help to bring food 
                              <br />
                              production closer to consumers, reducing transportation costs and carbon emissions 
                              <br />
